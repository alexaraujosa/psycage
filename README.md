# LI II - Roguelite

## Description
The Roguelite project was developed as part of the **Laboratórios de Informática II (LI2)** course. The goal is to implement a roguelite-style game using C programming language and ncurses for a text-based interface.

### 🎯 Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to apply **Event-driven programming** principles, including:
- Encapsulation and modularization
- Usage of external libraries (ncurses)
- Implementation of procedural map generation algorithms
- User input handling and game state updates
- Design and development of real-time game mechanics
- Development tools and debugging practices

### 🚀 Key Features:
- **Menus**: A structured menu system for navigation and game options.
- **Bot AI & Movement**: NPCs with movement patterns and behaviors.
- **Combat System**: Melee and ranged combat mechanics with different weapon types.
- **Power System**: Special abilities or attacks that can be used depending on the player class.
- **Effect System**: Effects created by grenades and potions.
- **Level System**: Progressive difficulty, more enemies, and challenges as the player advances.
- **Sanity System**: A mechanic influencing gameplay based on the player’s mental state.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- **C Programming**: Pointer manipulation and modular code structure.
- **Procedural Generation**: Algorithms for dynamic map creation and random enemy/items placement.
- **User Interaction**: Handling real-time inputs and UI updates via ncurses.
- **AI Behavior**: Implementing decision-making logic for enemy movement and attack patterns.
- **Game Design Principles**: Balancing difficulty and resource management.

## 🚧 Areas for Improvement
- **Memory Management**: Ensuring efficient allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust mechanisms to ensure game stability.
- **Game Balance**: Fine-tuning difficulty progression to enhance player experience.
